#  Hybrid Search with Pinecone BM25Encoder

- Hybrid search combines semantic and keyword search in one query for more relevant results.
- In Pinecone, we can perform hybrid search with sparse-dense vectors. 
- Sparse-dense vectors combine dense and sparse embeddings as a single vector. 
- Sparse and dense vectors represent different types of information and enable distinct kinds of search.


### Dense vectors
Dense vectors enable semantic search. 
Semantic search returns the most similar results according to a specific distance metric even if no exact matches are present. 
This is possible because dense vectors generated by embedding models such as SBERT are numerical representations of semantic meaning.

### Sparse vectors
Sparse vectors have very large number of dimensions, where only a small proportion of values are non-zero. 
When used for keywords search, each sparse vector represents a document;
the dimensions represent words from a dictionary, and the values represent the importance of these words in the document. 
Keyword search algorithms like the BM25 algorithm compute the relevance of text documents based on the number of keyword matches, their frequency, and other factors.




# How To Scale Hybrrid Vector Search By Using a Convex Combination\

###  alpha * dense + (1 - alpha) * sparse
###  dense: Array of floats representing
###  sparse: a dict of `indices` and `values`
###  alpha: float between 0 and 1 where 0 == sparse only and 1 == dense only
